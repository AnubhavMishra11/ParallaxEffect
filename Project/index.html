        <p class="text">Rallying as a form of road competition can be traced back to the origins of motorsport,
            including the world's
            first
            known motor race; the 1894 Paris–Rouen Horseless Carriage Competition (Concours des Voitures sans Chevaux).
            Sponsored by
            a Paris newspaper, Le Petit Journal, it attracted considerable public interest and entries from leading
            manufacturers.
            The official winner was Albert Lemaître driving a 3 hp Peugeot, although the Comte de Dion had finished
            first but his
            steam-powered vehicle was ineligible for the official competition.
            <br>
            <br>
            The event led to a period of city-to-city road races being organised in Europe and the USA, which introduced
            many of the
            features found in later rallies: individual start times with cars running against the clock rather than head
            to head;
            time controls at the entry and exit points of towns along the way; road books and route notes; and driving
            over long
            distances on ordinary, mainly gravel, roads, facing hazards such as dust, traffic, pedestrians and farm
            animals

            Off-roading is the activity of driving or riding in a vehicle on unpaved surfaces such as sand, gravel,
            riverbeds, mud,
            snow, rocks, and other natural terrain. Types of off-roading range in intensity, from leisure drives with
            unmodified
            vehicles, to competitions with customized vehicles and professional drivers. Off-roaders have been met with
            criticism
            for the environmental damage caused by their vehicles. There have also been extensive debates over the role
            of
            government in regulating the sport, including a Supreme Court case brought against the Bureau of Land
            Management in the
            United States.

            <h2 class="desc">Drag Race</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Drag Race is an American reality competition television series, the first in the Drag Race franchise,
            produced by World
            of Wonder for Logo TV (season 1–8), WOW Presents Plus, VH1 (season 9–14) and, beginning with the fifteenth
            season, MTV.
            The show documents RuPaul in the search for "America's next drag superstar".[1] RuPaul plays the role of
            host, mentor,
            and head judge for this series, as contestants are given different challenges each week. Contestants are
            judged by a
            panel that includes RuPaul, Michelle Visage, an alternating third main judge of either Carson Kressley, Ross
            Mathews, or
            Ts Madison,[2] and one or more guest judges, who critique their progress throughout the competition. The
            title of the
            show is a play on drag queen and drag racing, and the title sequence and song "Drag Race" both have a
            drag-racing theme.

            Drag Race contestants submit video auditions to the show's production company, World of Wonder.[7] RuPaul,
            the host and
            head judge, views each tape and selects the season's competitors.[8] Once the chosen pool of performers is
            on set, they
            film a series of episodes in which they compete against each other in various challenges. Each episode
            typically
            concludes with the removal of one contestant from the competition. Rarely, the outcome of an episode has
            been a double
            elimination,[9][10] no elimination,[11] contestant disqualification[10] or removal of a contestant on
            medical
            grounds.[10] Each episode features a so-called maxi challenge

        <p class="text">
            Formula One (more commonly known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international racing for
            open-wheel
            single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA
            Formula One
            World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season
            in 1950. The
            word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform.[1] A
            Formula One
            season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and
            continents
            around the world on either purpose-built circuits or closed public roads.

            A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for the drivers, and
            one for the
            constructors (the teams). Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence
            issued by the
            FIA,[2] and the races must be held on tracks graded "1", the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA for
            tracks.[2]
